0,1.0,"Disappointed with Oneplus, but more so with Amazon","I have been Oneplus user now for last 7 years and couldn't look beyond Oneplus brand even for my new phone. I used a Nokia feature phone for 15 days, after my Oneplus 7 broke into two pieces, to get my hands on Oneplus 10R. My first impression of the phone was that it felt quite bulky and heavy compared to other phones. The first one hour of phone usage was normal until I inserted the sim cards. Three major issues faced were:1. The network connectivity kept on flickering every 2nd second (That's how bad it is..!)2. The screen turns off in the middle of usage of phones (Typing, watching videos, surfing etc.) Looked like a buggy software to me.3. The phone took 1.5-2 hours to charge (80 watt model) as compared to their claims of a full charge in ~35 minutes..!I hoped that the update to 12.1 Oxygen OS will fix this, but it did solve neither of the problems.But major disappointment was from Amazon. I requested for a replacement after downloading the app and the app submitting the performance issues to Amazon. The Amazon representative raised the replacement request and the new phone was supposed to be delivered next day and they didn't. I had to travel to another city and this just made it more difficult. On the 3rd day, after multiple follow ups, another person from Amazon comes to check the phone and tells me that the replacement will be delivered same day in the evening. And guess what? Amazon cancelled the replacement itself. After complaints on twitter and their supervisors etc, they informed that I will be refunded the entire amount for the phone. 2 days to this and I'm still waiting for the phone to get picked up (and of course refund.!) In this entire 3 days process, Amazon team has lied on face regarding the cancelled replacement in chats as well as on Twitter...!Since I did not have any smart phone in the interim (and life without it is quite tough), I went to the service center who informed me that the software may not have been installed correctly in the beginning. They corrected it and it seems to be working ok so far for first 2 issues mentioned above but not the battery issue. They also have informed that if the issues persist, you can get the phone replaced from Oneplus.I still prefer this phone to be returned to Amazon and refunded fully.Update 1 (June 10) - After a month long fight with amazon to pick up my phone from the different city, I finally had to self return it. (Since they screwed up multiple times by not picking the phone up, they asked me to self return and refunded fully.)Update 2 (June 12) - I wanted a premium phone with latest processor under 40k and did not find good options in any other brand. (Do not trust the Xiomi and Realme of the world to give ad-free experience and clutter-free software, Samsung & Apple out of budget). So I again ordered a new Oneplus 10R. This time, it seems to be running smoothly. Black looks much better and feels more premium than green.",11 May 2022
1,1.0,The worst One Plus phone ever,"The worst phone from One Plus. Not recommended. Cheap Look and Design. Slow performance. Not worth for 39K. If you are exchanging any of your older phone, for sure you are going to miss your golden phone for a Bakwas phone. Try not to buy this phone.",10 May 2022
2,5.0,Good Budget Flagship,Nice PhonePros+Flat Display+Nice chipset+Battery and fast charging+DesignCons-average camera-slightly expensive,10 May 2022
3,1.0,ONEPLUS HAS LOST ITS ORIGINALITY,"One of the worst phone of OnePlus. It's more of Oppo stuff...The body is made of cheap plastic and for 40k range there is no X Factor. Addition to this, when i rcvd the phone the SIMs are not getting detected. On checking the IMEI number, it is reflecting as Null (screenshot attached)...This is a manufacturing defect that the device is not having an IMEI number. Total Chinese material. Coming to the battery..the phone gets fully charged in about 30 mins with 80 watt charger but the charger itself gets heat up like anything and after full charge also the battery supports for about 5-7 hrs only...With moderate use you have to charge the device minimum 2-3 times. Moreover, once i initiated the replacement for the same the procedure is cumbersome. First their technician will come and check the phone and after his approval the device will be returned and then the replacement will be initiated. It means I've to wait for another 7-10 days for this plastic box. There is no procedure to return the device with manufacturing defect...it can only be replaced. Total waste of money...avoid OnePlus and go for other brands providing same features and specs at 60% of the OnePlus rates. OnePlus devices henceforth are just rebranding of the other counterparts in the market. Don't buy this phone.. you'll regret it.",10 May 2022

6,4.0,Good but not the best,Pros:-awesome display-good battery backup-takes 35 mins from 0 to 100% with 80W charger-good camera. Sample attached. Although expected better quality from oneplus. Hope camera will be optimised with future updates.-good performanceCons:-device does not look premium. but looks good if you use with case.-I have upgraded my oneplus 6T (OxygenOS 11.1 on android 11). But not happy with the the OS. Automatic call recording is missing. Oneplus needs to enhance OS for better user experience.I did not use alert slider much. So I don't have any issue with this.I donot play games much. So no heating issue with normal usage.Overall good but not the best. Hope oneplus will fix the camera and OS experience with its future updates.,11 May 2022

9,2.0,I am a OnePlus fan but didn't like this phone,"I am a OnePlus fan & a very long time OnePlus phones user. But I didn't like this phone at all. UI & UX are not as good as older OnePlus phones. Some of the key features of OnePlus are missing too. Touch is slower. Changing & battery life are not as good as claimed. Overall, I do not feel that it is worth the price.",12 May 2022

12,5.0,"A ""different"" OnePlus","Bought this phone in the inaugural sale. Been using it for 2 days now.Pros:1. Processor is great. Dimensity 8100 MAX works better than the Snapdragon 888 imo.2. Camera is very good, but nothing that you cannot find in phones in the range 25-30k3. Display is premium4. Design is different and very good according to me, but depends on personal taste.Cons:1. 5000 mAH battery but drains quickly although charging is pretty quick even with the 80W charger.2. No glass back, which would have made the phone look premium.3. No alert sliderThere were some issues that I saw in unboxing videos regarding refresh rate on apps like Instagram, but these have been fixed with an update already.Direct competitor of the Realme GT Neo 3, but I wanted a taste of OnePlus. In essence both phones are identical.",11 May 2022
13,1.0,Not a flagship level phone at this price range.,Front camera is not working well in low light and pictures got blurry in video call. Totally a bad product in terms of performance too.I didn't expect that from one plus.,13 May 2022
14,1.0,Not a premium phone,I am moving from OnePlus 5to this after 5yrs. And I am not even sure that it will survive for 2yrs.. poor camera selfie is too much whitesh.  No control on colour in main camera. Throwing every garbage pic..Plastic all around. On screen fingerprint is prone to error if screen get toomuch dust hand print. Feel cheated when I seen oppo and realme name tag internal system.Charging fast but discharge is also fast. Charger charge in 20 min but too bulky to carry around.

17,3.0,Average Buy....,I have been using this phone for about 5-6days now. It falls under good category. I say it is average. But not a flagship phone though!!Cons:Video- Slow motion mode has an issue. It flickers while using. Is it an issue with my phone or this an issue with one plus 10r am not sure... Camera is ok I would say. Not upto the expectations though it is 50megapixel.Sound quality is also average...Hoping that OnePlus team sets it right in their next updates.... Battery is very bad it drains too quickly... Charges quickly but drains as quickly as it charges too...,12 May 2022
18,3.0,Battery drains very fast,"It is true that battery charging is very fast but, it drains very fast. I have been using Oneplus 6, Oneplus 9R and battery is one of the strengths of this mobile phone. It is too disappointing to see the battery performance 10R 5G. Is it a generic problem? I am considering to go back replace item with Oneplus9 by returning this.",11 May 2022
19,2.0,Not a OnePlus flagship phone for sure,This phone is a disappointment at this price. Just by seeing the phone can say this is not up to the mark.Had an issue with microphone. Dealing with Amazon representatives to return the phone has been very difficult job. Amazon can do better than this.Literally had to speak with 8 people to make then understand what's the issue.They way Amazon gives certificate when asked for return whether phone is good or defective with an app is rediculous.How come an application take care of all the real world scenarios..At last A guy named Sanjay understood the issue and helped me process the return.,14 May 2022
20,2.0,Felt being cheated to with the camera quality at 43000 Rs.,"Camera quality is poor, comparison can be from Redmi's 6-7 k Rs phone.Redmi's 15-18k phone gives very good camera experience but this one being my first OnePlus phone disappointed big time on camera.Battery charging speed is good.Not a good buy at ""42000 Rs"" 😢",15 May 2022

31,3.0,Not worth the money,"Reviewing this after using for couple weeks. Charging fast as expected, battery life pretty good. With full charge, it lasts a whole day with moderate usage.Camera not bad.No heating issue.However, the UI is bad, lots of features older OS/models had are missing. Some of the apps does not work properly.Sudio output is not good. Even the volume levels not good when connected to Bluetooth speaker.Doesn't auto connect to Bluetooth devices properly.Has issues with network connection dropping sometimes.Not much options to personalize.Definately not worth 43k.My old one+6 is much better than this.",28 May 2022
32,1.0,Pathetic camera,"Guys just go for some renowed brand, one plus phones quality is pathetic now, if you are looking for camera phone , just avoid one plus",15 May 2022
33,2.0,Not worth it buying.....,"Using since last 3 weeks,Pros1. Charging in 20 mins from 0 to 100Cons1. Everything in this phone for 43k apart from charging is con.This phone can be considered as 16k-20k phone, company didn't worked on UI, UX or any basic thing, they just get one software suitable to run hardware at bare minimum and left it.Sent feedback to company so many times about a lot of problems in almost every single aspect u touch  on this phone. Camera is not upto the mark, OIS doesnt work, snaps are over saturated, video comes blurry at highest possible settings with AI """" enabled.They have copied half of the things from realme UI that too those things works better in realme only and lags and feels shady on this phone.One more major issue is there on this phone is phone colors goes greyscale when we lower the brightness of the phone, u can suddenly feel that u might be using 10 year old nokia color phone after lowering the brightness of screen, cors will be faded, every black color will appear as grey and it will feel ugly as like as cheapest chinese phones.Ringtones may ring and stop ring and stop by itnself without changing any settings sometimes sometimes they goes smoothly.Company has just made this phone to looto people they has nothing to do with this phone and its users that is what i got after trying to their customer support too.Finding good deal to exchange this phone ASAP.Go with Google Pixel....",5 June 2022

37,3.0,Good Phone,"I have been using OnePlus 7 pro for more than 2years. It's way different from other OnePlus phones in all aspects. Though Oxygen OS 12 has some bugs, it is fluidy smooth. Camera is average not that best. Performance with all the specs OnePlus 10R provides is the best. Speakers are standard. Display is decent with the price range. No IP rating. Light weight phone. But definitely it's a good phone and  a worth upgrade. I like the flat design even though it is not a pocket friendly phone.Overall - 3.5/5",15 May 2022
38,1.0,Not worth the price. Don't buy.,"Not worth a penny more than 25k.PROS1. Display is decent.2. Charging speed is decent.CONS1. Processor. I can assure you it's not as good as snapdragon.2. Battery life is very bad. Drains very quick within half a day. THIS IS A HUGE CON.3. Heating issues. Honestly didn't expect from Oneplus. But unfortunately it's a OPPO rebranded phone so no wonder it has heating issues.4. No alert slider.5. Touch sensitivity is not as good as the price range. Touch lags often.Definitely not worth the price, don't buy.I'm using iqoo3 (snapdragon 865) for past 2 and half years. As of today it still performs far better than 10R.Other than the display, nothing in 10R is better than iqoo3.",9 June 2022

I am looking for a squarer designed phone like we used to have in old iphones and the latest iPhone 13. I don't like the round edging devices but recently no other device comes with flat and square design, and when I saw this phone I fall in love with its design. Here are the pros:1. Great and different design.2. Awesome screen quality with 120 hertz.3. Great battery life and charging. It took 35 to 40 min for me to charge from 0 to 100 using 80 watt charger.4. Super smooth OS and no bloatware.5. Great haptic response.",22 May 2022

50,5.0,One plus 10R best phone at the moment.,"Based on the looks OnePlus 10R is a little wired but this phone has good specs and it can give a good performance!First, the 120 Hz Fluid OLED display is amazing because OLED is the best display in other devices too, also it gives the best quality viewing which doesn't strain the eyes like the LCD displays. The Dimensity 8100-MAX CPU is as good .it will give a smooth and good performance when it comes to apps, gaming, entertainment, etc, and also good for battery life because the phone will be smooth and don't struggle so the battery will not drain fast! A 4500 mAh Battery is a beast that will give enough power for more than 1.5 days, this battery is great and an 150W SUPERVOOC charger will charge the phone in 30 mins! and 150W charger is for 4500 mAh battery. One of the main specs of the phone is the Storage which is as usual 12GB Ram with 256GB storage, this is amazing & very effective. The Camera is great in OnePlus phones and in this model, it is better with the sony sensor and 16MP Front Camera, 50MP main camera, Ultra wide-angle with 8MP, and Marco Lens is included with 2MP  The In-display Fingerprint Sensor is great and it is added as usual for a flagship phone, Dual Stereo Speakers are also a plus for listening to music and watching videos. Overall for a price starting at 42K this phone is a good value for money compared to other flagship phones! The back of the phone looks wired as I said so I might put on the skin",26 May 2022

190,1.0,"Disappointed with Oneplus, but more so with Amazon","I have been Oneplus user now for last 7 years and couldn't look beyond Oneplus brand even for my new phone. I used a Nokia feature phone for 15 days, after my Oneplus 7 broke into two pieces, to get my hands on Oneplus 10R. My first impression of the phone was that it felt quite bulky and heavy compared to other phones. The first one hour of phone usage was normal until I inserted the sim cards. Three major issues faced were:1. The network connectivity kept on flickering every 2nd second (That's how bad it is..!)2. The screen turns off in the middle of usage of phones (Typing, watching videos, surfing etc.) Looked like a buggy software to me.3. The phone took 1.5-2 hours to charge (80 watt model) as compared to their claims of a full charge in ~35 minutes..!I hoped that the update to 12.1 Oxygen OS will fix this, but it did solve neither of the problems.But major disappointment was from Amazon. I requested for a replacement after downloading the app and the app submitting the performance issues to Amazon. The Amazon representative raised the replacement request and the new phone was supposed to be delivered next day and they didn't. I had to travel to another city and this just made it more difficult. On the 3rd day, after multiple follow ups, another person from Amazon comes to check the phone and tells me that the replacement will be delivered same day in the evening. And guess what? Amazon cancelled the replacement itself. After complaints on twitter and their supervisors etc, they informed that I will be refunded the entire amount for the phone. 2 days to this and I'm still waiting for the phone to get picked up (and of course refund.!) In this entire 3 days process, Amazon team has lied on face regarding the cancelled replacement in chats as well as on Twitter...!Since I did not have any smart phone in the interim (and life without it is quite tough), I went to the service center who informed me that the software may not have been installed correctly in the beginning. They corrected it and it seems to be working ok so far for first 2 issues mentioned above but not the battery issue. They also have informed that if the issues persist, you can get the phone replaced from Oneplus.I still prefer this phone to be returned to Amazon and refunded fully.Update 1 (June 10) - After a month long fight with amazon to pick up my phone from the different city, I finally had to self return it. (Since they screwed up multiple times by not picking the phone up, they asked me to self return and refunded fully.)Update 2 (June 12) - I wanted a premium phone with latest processor under 40k and did not find good options in any other brand. (Do not trust the Xiomi and Realme of the world to give ad-free experience and clutter-free software, Samsung & Apple out of budget). So I again ordered a new Oneplus 10R. This time, it seems to be running smoothly. Black looks much better and feels more premium than green.",11 May 2022
191,1.0,The worst One Plus phone ever,"The worst phone from One Plus. Not recommended. Cheap Look and Design. Slow performance. Not worth for 39K.

193,1.0,ONEPLUS HAS LOST ITS ORIGINALITY,"One of the worst phone of OnePlus. It's more of Oppo stuff...The body is made of cheap plastic and for 40k range there is no X Factor. Addition to this, when i rcvd the phone the SIMs are not getting detected. On checking the IMEI number, it is reflecting as Null (screenshot attached)...This is a manufacturing defect that the device is not having an IMEI number. Total Chinese material. Coming to the battery..the phone gets fully charged in about 30 mins with 80 watt charger but the charger itself gets heat up like anything and after full charge also the battery supports for about 5-7 hrs only...With moderate use you have to charge the device minimum 2-3 times. Moreover, once i initiated the replacement for the same the procedure is cumbersome. First their technician will come and check the phone and after his approval the device will be returned and then the replacement will be initiated. It means I've to wait for another 7-10 days for this plastic box. There is no procedure to return the device with manufacturing defect...it can only be replaced. Total waste of money...avoid OnePlus and go for other brands providing same features and specs at 60% of the OnePlus rates. OnePlus devices henceforth are just rebranding of the other counterparts in the market. Don't buy this phone.. you'll regret it.",10 May 2022

196,4.0,Good but not the best,Pros:-awesome display-good battery backup-takes 35 mins from 0 to 100% with 80W charger-good camera. Sample attached. Although expected better quality from oneplus. Hope camera will be optimised with future updates.-good performanceCons:-device does not look premium. but looks good if you use with case.-I have upgraded my oneplus 6T (OxygenOS 11.1 on android 11). But not happy with the the OS. Automatic call recording is missing. Oneplus needs to enhance OS for better user experience.I did not use alert slider much. So I don't have any issue with this.I donot play games much. So no heating issue with normal usage.Overall good but not the best. Hope oneplus will fix the camera and OS experience with its future updates.,11 May 2022

Design is different and very good according to me, but depends on personal taste.Cons:1. 5000 mAH battery but drains quickly although charging is pretty quick even with the 80W charger.2. No glass back, which would have made the phone look premium.3. No alert sliderThere were some issues that I saw in unboxing videos regarding refresh rate on apps like Instagram, but these have been fixed with an update already.Direct competitor of the Realme GT Neo 3, but I wanted a taste of OnePlus.

207,3.0,Average Buy....,I have been using this phone for about 5-6days now. It falls under good category. I say it is average. But not a flagship phone though!!Cons:Video- Slow motion mode has an issue. It flickers while using. Is it an issue with my phone or this an issue with one plus 10r am not sure... Camera is ok I would say. Not upto the expectations though it is 50megapixel.Sound quality is also average...Hoping that OnePlus team sets it right in their next updates.... Battery is very bad it drains too quickly... Charges quickly but drains as quickly as it charges too...,12 May 2022

I have been using Oneplus 6, Oneplus 9R and battery is one of the strengths of this mobile phone. It is too disappointing to see the battery performance 10R 5G. Is it a generic problem? I am considering to go back replace item with Oneplus9 by returning this.",11 May 2022
209,2.0,Not a OnePlus flagship phone for sure,This phone is a disappointment at this price. Just by seeing the phone can say this is not up to the mark.Had an issue with microphone. Dealing with Amazon representatives to return the phone has been very difficult job. Amazon can do better than this.Literally had to speak with 8 people to make then understand what's the issue.They way Amazon gives certificate when asked for return whether phone is good or defective with an app is rediculous.How come an application take care of all the real world scenarios..At last A guy named Sanjay understood the issue and helped me process the return.,14 May 2022

Everything in this phone for 43k apart from charging is con.This phone can be considered as 16k-20k phone, company didn't worked on UI, UX or any basic thing, they just get one software suitable to run hardware at bare minimum and left it.Sent feedback to company so many times about a lot of problems in almost every single aspect u touch  on this phone. Camera is not upto the mark, OIS doesnt work, snaps are over saturated, video comes blurry at highest possible settings with AI """" enabled.They have copied half of the things from realme UI that too those things works better in realme only and lags and feels shady on this phone.One more major issue is there on this phone is phone colors goes greyscale when we lower the brightness of the phone, u can suddenly feel that u might be using 10 year old nokia color phone after lowering the brightness of screen, cors will be faded, every black color will appear as grey and it will feel ugly as like as cheapest chinese phones.Ringtones may ring and stop ring and stop by itnself without changing any settings sometimes sometimes they goes smoothly.Company has just made this phone to looto people they has nothing to do with this phone and its users that is what i got after trying to their customer support too.Finding good deal to exchange this phone ASAP.Go with Google Pixel....",5 June 2022

Camera is average not that best. Performance with all the specs OnePlus 10R provides is the best. Speakers are standard. Display is decent with the price range. No IP rating. Light weight phone. But definitely it's a good phone and  a worth upgrade. I like the flat design even though it is not a pocket friendly phone.Overall - 3.5/5",15 May 2022

Battery life is very bad. Drains very quick within half a day. THIS IS A HUGE CON.3. Heating issues. Honestly didn't expect from Oneplus. But unfortunately it's a OPPO rebranded phone so no wonder it has heating issues.4. No alert slider.5. Touch sensitivity is not as good as the price range. Touch lags often.Definitely not worth the price, don't buy.I'm using iqoo3 (snapdragon 865) for past 2 and half years.

240,5.0,One plus 10R best phone at the moment.,"Based on the looks OnePlus 10R is a little wired but this phone has good specs and it can give a good performance!First, the 120 Hz Fluid OLED display is amazing because OLED is the best display in other devices too, also it gives the best quality viewing which doesn't strain the eyes like the LCD displays. The Dimensity 8100-MAX CPU is as good .it will give a smooth and good performance when it comes to apps, gaming, entertainment, etc, and also good for battery life because the phone will be smooth and don't struggle so the battery will not drain fast! A 4500 mAh Battery is a beast that will give enough power for more than 1.5 days, this battery is great and an 150W SUPERVOOC charger will charge the phone in 30 mins! and 150W charger is for 4500 mAh battery. One of the main specs of the phone is the Storage which is as usual 12GB Ram with 256GB storage, this is amazing & very effective. The Camera is great in OnePlus phones and in this model, it is better with the sony sensor and 16MP Front Camera, 50MP main camera, Ultra wide-angle with 8MP, and Marco Lens is included with 2MP  The In-display Fingerprint Sensor is great and it is added as usual for a flagship phone, Dual Stereo Speakers are also a plus for listening to music and watching videos. Overall for a price starting at 42K this phone is a good value for money compared to other flagship phones! The back of the phone looks wired as I said so I might put on the skin",26 May 2022

409,2.0,Phone is not optimized for some of the functionality buy it if you get it for 32-35k INR with offer.,"I bought this phone yesterday and over the night I used it. One thing I can say is that this phone is something which you do not want to buy even in your worst nightmares! Paying 38,999 or 43,999 for this worst phone is really one should avoid. This phone has a lot of issues which one plus has not address and the phone has not been optimized for a lot of function yet. you will find that a lot of apps are not working how they should be working on other phones. And the worst part is that when I went to return this phone to Amazon they slapped their policy on my face that we cannot take this phone back and now the curse is on you now. I am not able to configure my office outlook and MS teams on this phone because this phone has some issues which oneplus is still not able to figure out. You can check the forum for oneplus online. Also 120Hz will work only on videos and your menu of the phone but it stops working on all other apps that you download from Playstore. Battery back up is also not so good. so If you have all the black money that you earned then you can go ahead and buy this phone. Rest I just want to say all the best to you all!Edit: After using it for 3-4 days, I can say that camera quality is good. Battery is also working fine, average screen time this phone is giving is close to 6.5 hours which is not bad but could be more than 7 since it has 5000 mAh battery. Also sound quality is not so bad not so good but yes good part is it has two speakers. so yeah I can live with this phone but the price of the 12 GB Ram and 256 Gb version should have been around 32-35k INR. and at last I am giving one more start just for the screen clarity and camera.",6 June 2022
410,4.0,It's a good phone with few disappointments.,"I have been using this phone since the day it was released.It is a good phone considering:- Great display; it's bright and colours are very punchy.- Good battery life; Phone can easily last a day in normal usage with 6-7hrs of SOT.- No heating issues whatsoever; I have been reading few reviews about heating issues personally I didn't faced any. But ofcourse this also depends on so many factors like temperature at the user's location, what he/she is doing etc.- Phone feels very durable; since it has polycarbonate frame and back the phone feels sturdy. But, this may be a con for few as the phone doesn't looks premium considering the price and previous generation OnePlus devices.- Operating System is still OxygenOS with few USEFUL features from ColorOS like Sleep standby for less overnight battery drain, Optimized Night charging for long-term battery health etc. Ofcourse there are also few features which are not necessary.- 80W fast charging, just DAMN!!But ofcourse there are few disappointments:- No alert slider on a ₹40k device!!!- Looks a bit cheap considering the price. (personal opinion)- Camera performance is average I guess, not my field.Personally I couldn't find any more.- They need to work a lot more on their software and updates.There are few comments like could buy Realme's instead, ofcourse you can buy it for ads, bloatware and bulky & sh*tty UI.Also, if you have second thoughts due to MediaTek processors, then you can put your mind at ease because DM 8100-MAX is a very capable processor, it's performance is very close to SD888. In performance you won't have any issues.In the end I would say- yes I have seen the review videos on YouTube in real life it is as bad as they are making it look. If you want a premium looking phone then buy 9RT or look for any other brands but definitely you can consider this phone (atleast the base variant) for good hardware and clean fluent UI.",2 June 2022
