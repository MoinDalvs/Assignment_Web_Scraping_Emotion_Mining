 It’s A average product decent for day to day activity.. one the thing I would like to mention that exchange was Far Far alot Good On amazon it was like 2 to 3 minutes and delivery agent was very Good with me although I had 2 scratches on it but he neglected it as it was minor scratches and I exchanged poco m2 pro 6 64gb variant which was exchanged for rupees 10100. I bought it at 12499 1 and Half year ago and sold it at at very good price!! So plus point To amazonComing Back to device I would say it’s a ok device camera is average performance is Fine one plus is losing it’s originality oxygen os to color or..WARP CHARGER TO VOOC CHARGER!! yes it has been taken by oppo!! I wish the way we believed in one plus doesn’t change with it as A one plus Fan We don’t want To merge with Other brands please keep your Originality Maintained!! thanx amazon for such a hasselfree exchange alot better than FLIPKART",28 February 2022
4,1.0,Read,I got my delivery on 23 feb when I unboxed the phone the display was damaged. I requested for replacement of my new phone so technician was suppose to come for inspection but instead of a visit he just talked on call and asked me to install an application. He did not even saw the damage of my display screen.Lets hope amazon does it right replace my phone. Will update the rest later.But amazon pls consider my request and replace the item as soon as possibleEdit- The phone is perfect... They replaced it and now everything is perfect...Camera quality is as expected very perfectOverall performance bestYou can go for it,26 February 2022
5,4.0,Fantastic but some bug fixes required!,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Phone is is Fab!But sometime apps like Gaana, LinkedIn, etc are crashing, I think need to fix some bugs from OnePlus end.However, camera is good, finishing quality is good, sound effect could be better(not that load as compared to iPhone or other Mi phones)Touch is awesome, finger print sensor works too fast, excellent face detection unlockMost sexiest thing is charging, it charges way too quickly, 35-40min approx for full chageMany more extra features from Android Oxygen & One plus!!Phone is handy & a good buy in this range!",26 February 2022
6,5.0,A good choice for upgrade,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",27 February 2022
7,3.0,Camera is not good... oppo is the best,"Phone is over all good but some heating problem,and selfie 🤳 is not too good.Other wise phone is good",25 February 2022
8,1.0,****VERY DISPOINTED BY 1PLUS****. Sound and back camera poor quality.,"****Don't buy any phones from Amazon*** i really had a bad exp. DISLIKE:For 25k poor build quality. Same configuration in real me etc are coming less than 18k only. Just for 1+ brand don't buy for 25k.---> Audio is worst, single speaker but volume too low in calls for other end. I think phone mic issues.----> Back camera not good---> phone touch also I felt bit lack.Like:--------+Fast charging, within 30min 100% charge .Front cam bit okay.Battery backup is good.8 5g bands. Support, dual 4g standby.**** If OnePlus can promise if they can do something on back camera quality and Audio improvements with updates buy it with any offers. Otherwise go for real me gt master or 9pro or 9pro plus.  And moto mobiles also good. I was using moto for 6years for only good camera and sound i took this but those two only drawback for this phone rest all okay manageble. And no return policy only replacement.",28 February 2022

 The Grey mirror finish is really cool and the phone is smooth in day to day usage. Charging speed is very fast but i couldn't test 0 to 100. As an estimate it'll take 30-45 mins for a full charge (Will update after testing). Cameras are all good and in par with RM9pro+(I do have it) especially the front cam. Overall it's a very good phone in this price range.",27 February 2022

12,4.0,A decent package for non gamers and everything thing is decent not the best out there,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",26 February 2022
13,4.0,Good overall performance,Bought this for my mother on the day of the launch. Lightweight and slim phone. Good look and specifications. The refresh rate is amazing given the cost. Satisfied with the product so far.,25 February 2022
14,5.0,Better than Realme 9 Pro+,"The media could not be loaded.

15,5.0,Amazing Phone,"Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good. See attached photo taken from 5 th floor.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Netflix. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 yes warranty. Seems like company is preety sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.Best of luck Chinese company... Till the time India doesn't develop its own effective mobile, keep earning. We will catch you soon!!",26 February 2022
16,5.0,Mid ranger Flagship.,I got this mobile for ₹ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ₹3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ₹20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,27 February 2022

 I don't how the plethora of "" youtubers"" missed the obvious pointers. I am upgrading from redmi note 9 pro max, thus  never had very high expectations . This is review after 3 days of usage :-1) The UI is extremely clean and works like charm!! Make sure you do go display>screen refresh rate> 90 hz2) Please make sure you add your finger prints before adding tempered glass!! Very important3) Battery charges in 30-35 minutes.4) Pubg will give consistent 56-60 fps in smooth plus extreme5) Ok now, the most important point which I pray would go be improved in future updates!! The screen jitters like shit while scrolling webpages on Google Chrome. The only solution for this is to turn on high performance mode . The path for the same is Battery>additional setting > high performance modeHope this helps!!!Would let you guys know more after using this beast for a month!",14 April 2022

28,3.0,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",28 February 2022

Also the night charging is great the phone automatically optimises how fast to charge the mobile so that it reaches 100% at 6 in the morning.Happy till now with the purchase.Though there is a downside I hated the google phone and contact app I am badly missing the stock OnePlus apps, this is OnePlus not some android phone please don't use third party apps just be yourself you are gr8.",26 February 2022

50,5.0,Great value phone for the price!,"I made the switch from my Samsung M51 to the Nord CE 2. I did a lot of research before settling on this phone. I read quite a lot of reviews as well. Here's my experience so far:1. I am not a gamer and do not use phones for gaming.2. I am not a photographer and am quite happy with simple photos. I don't care about contrast or saturation.3. I use my phone mainly for banking, messaging, browsing and calls.Switching from the Samsung M51, the Nord CE 2 feels a lot smoother. I can't tell much of a difference in the display between the two. The outdoor brightness for the phone is decent. There is no bloatware installed on the phone which is fantastic (Samsung needs to learn from this!). Sure, there is no Android 12 out of the box but I don't miss it since I've never used it and Android 11 is perfectly fine. The phone will receive the Android 12 update but it might take time (I'm in no hurry). The camera is fine for my needs. It comes with a headphone jack and a charger. Charging is fast -- I went from 50% to 100% in under 25 minutes. I also like that the phone is slightly smaller than the M51 and fits well in my hand and pocket. I've not experienced any overheating issues.Overall, for the price (I got a great deal since I exchanged my phone), it's a great phone. Some people are expecting too much from this phone but if your needs are simple like mine, this is an excellent device.",2 May 2022

I am a true one plus fan. So my review on this phone is that it very basic.To be honest I am disappointed with the phone. I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is 👌🏻Cons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay. But this is no where near to high gaming or photo fan phone",6 March 2022

Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12. It's just one weeks of usage and there's a lot of issues don't know where to report.Thanks for reading. This is my honest review on this device.",29 April 2022

Though i clearly showed that the phone is not starting and also the reset did not work and the phone is still not able to boot. Great.Edit: Replaced but delivery executive told this is the most returned product. So definitely there are issues. Lets see till when does this replacement works. First ever return in around 5-8 Phone from different company. One plus needs to step up or its same as getting any vivo/oppo/mi.

70,5.0,Absolutely Fantastic Phone,"Here are some important points that I noticed about the smartphone :1. Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.I am thankful to the seller for providing me the phone in best condition and I thank Amazon for free and fast delivery.",16 June 2022

79,4.0,One Plus is Brand,I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery 🔋 stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera 📸 is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.,28 March 2022
80,5.0,Best budget phone at this price!!!!,"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use.

This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box.",29 March 2022

Slider button is missing, however I was never use the slider button in my OnePlus 3 earlier. I got this phone at 16500 with exchange of my OnePlus 3 and some Amazon coupon. So it's worth to buy with offers.",25 March 2022
84,4.0,Affordable good quality.,"A big fan of 1+ phones n this is my fourth 1+ during last 6-7 years. Reason : Price competitive for the same specs of other Chinese competition makes. That brings the brand No. 2 in sales. But, definitely the brand's overall quality including battery is getting deteriorated since it has been started assembling in Vivo Noida plant.Now abt this product : Plastic type body doesn't give that bad impression, as often critics say. Other established brands in this range n specs r also have plastic body to make product lighter, though it adds to poor heat dissipation problem. U can't feel that unless u have ""never satisfied"" typo critic eyes.Call quality n internet performance is superb matching to processor specs. Can handle group video calls well in even weaker net. Picture quality is awesome with good color n in-depth reproduction. Heavier games make it hotter, but again that's the problem with every phone. Better remove phone cover while playing games.",3 April 2022

What warranty the company is offering if spare aren’t available. This was my first purcahse and i I think this will also turn out to be last with this kind of product and service.

Also microphones are also not working.Adding to above, I started using the phone nowdays as a hot pack to relieve my pains. A good relief for me. thanks to One plus for the multipurpose.

96,4.0,Worth the mid range.average performance of camera and phone.,I got my product delivered on 27/02/2022..since im using honor 10..flagship..kirin 970 chipset phone the performance of dimesity 900 doesnt seemed fast ...but performance is good as a mid ranger...camera is good and one can get the same performance in 12 to 14 k phone having 50 MP sensor or above..i liked the display.. phone sound is enough...firmware is oxygen os based on android 11...front and back both cameras are worth the range..fingerprint..face scan sensors are responsive..looks are subjective..but plastic back panel is giving cheap apperance..phone is a good mid ranger but priced a bit higher...,28 February 2022
97,1.0,What's the use of a phone when mic and speaker doesn't work properly.,"My OnePlus Nord 2 5G/ Nord CE 2 5G connected to broadband wifi.Now if I recieve call or make a call,- I can't hear other person voice clearly (it's breaking),- and other person also can't hear my voice clearly.If I turn off the wifi during the call, everything works fine.It's really ridiculous that these costly phones doesn't work for such a basic required functionality.I've tried two brand new OnePlus Nord 2 5G and 1 Nord CE 2 5G, everywhere it's same.(I've posted the same question on OnePlus forum, waiting for some solution, but I can see there are many people facing the same problem without any solution)",9 May 2022
98,4.0,A good phone to buy,"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period.",3 March 2022

FOR ME THATS THE AREA OF CONCERN.CAN #AMAZONE @ONEPLUS TEAM HELP ME OUT IF THIS???",1 March 2022
109,5.0,The OnePlus Experience.,"OnePlus kinda pulled this one out by a miracle.So the reason for this statement is because it feels too good to be true on the surface and if you are someone like me then there's a high chance you have watched every review of this phone already so lets see what we find :The build is like a Flagship, no issues and really well built feel in-hand. retains the audio jack on the sacrifice of the mute switch on the side but personally not a very big thing in usage at all. single speaker but loud like real loud. Type C with fast charging that charges the phone upto 70 in the first 20 mins then another 10-15 mins to reach 100 (that's like real fast for a charger guys). OS is the best side of this, default oxygen os with enough customization and do note that i was a Nova Launcher user so having an stock launcher that too on my daily driver means this thing rocks! . Performance is really good, easily beats any competition out there, no heating issues or battery drain issues or lag, had the best BGMI experience yet (Smooth+Extreme with constant 60FPS) thats really good and also good enough for any game you plan to play on the device. Cameras are a mix of the camera you would expect with a little more and for the price range they are great :)overall if you ask me (i got this phone for 17k) its a really great phone and you should just go with it, the best phone in the budget segment Period.",10 April 2022
110,4.0,Overall a good mid range phone by one plus.,Battery 🔋 life in average but takes very less time to recharge so it is okay. Camera is better than other phones of this range. Display is smooth and processor is as expected by one plus. I have previously used one plus 3T for 4 years. Definitely the quality of one plus phones is still up to mark. The only thing I didn't like is mirror back of phone as now a days better looking phones are available.,18 April 2022
111,4.0,Value for money phone but not happy with battery backup,"I have recently bought this phone 2 days back and I have exchanged my redmi note 7s for this which I was using for past 3 years,the exchange process was smooth and the delivery agent was helpful and very patient.Coming to the model,I m first time OnePlus user but people in my family were using OnePlus earlier, the camera quality and refresh rate is good I'm only disappointed by battery backup the phone charges in 15mins but at night when I sleep I switch off internet connection and the phone is on battery saver mode still phone lost 10% battery this is very disappointing that when I'm not even using it and the phone is new then why this is happening.",11 May 2022
112,5.0,Battery life: i charge the phone once a day.,"Camera is okayish, although the night mode and slow mo is quite cool, battery life is very long after long screen hour, lasts almost 24 hours (for me), in hand feeling is quite good, only the ringer button is absent and i literally could not figure yet how to make my phone in silent, it only switches between ring and vibrate. Otherwise till now good experience. Lookwise also it's really classy,.",1 April 2022
113,3.0,Average phone,I have used the phone more than 4 months. Battery backup is not up to the mark. Intially the battery gets charged very quickly but now it takes time to get charged. Camera quality is average and in low light it is worst. Not expected from one plus.  Touch is also average. Display is also average. One thing I would say this phone looks very beautiful and better than Samsung phones of this budget. Overall it's an average phone.,11 June 2022
114,3.0,Its very delicate!!,"I have no point of comparison except for my older oppo A83(2018) model. Thats an older model and yet very much better than the new ONE PLUS.  I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.😞 DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full. Thats the only feature I love about it.",13 April 2022

I raised an support request and meanwhile have done factory reset to handover to Amazon. I'm not sure how but factory reset has resolved the cam issue but the technician didn't visit Instead he called me and guided me to install a software and said the product is good and closed the request. Not satisfied with the support and what if my cam shows up same issue. I feel replacement/refund should be done, as this will not be possible after 2/3 days for my order.",12 May 2022

132,2.0,Bad product. Has heating issues,"I have ordered this item after doing lot of research for a good phone within my 25k budget. I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",28 May 2022

136,2.0,Not a value for money item,"Was having high expectations while buying. I own a Samsung S20 FE 5G and this OnePlus Nord CE2 was bought as a gift for mom. I should say that I was disappointed. There is a slight lag issue(many already reported, which I ignored while buying).Another thing I noticed is that, the call recording feature is hectic. Like the new phones, it starts the recording after the voice warning. But my S20 FE doesn't warn like this.Another thing is, the auto call recording can be enabled for all non-saved numbers, but for contacts saved in your phone, you would have to manually add them one by one to the list so that auto-recording would happen. That's the most stupid thing. Because most of us would have 1000s of contacts. And adding them one by one to the list for auto-call recording is a tedious task.Another issue is, the camera is way too below average. Expected a better camera from this phone.And I initially noticed some heating issue on the screen side.One advantage is that, the weight is less. So carrying it or using it with your hands won't be a headache.",20 June 2022

Great looks2. Light weight3. Good displayCons:1. Buggy OS, seriously needs an update. Hangs a lot, many app crashes. Many apps doesn't preserve it's state once minimised.2. Camera over beautification3. Single speaker4. Battery life is hardly half day for normal usage. But good thing is super fast charging.5.

149,4.0,Good decent buy!!!,"I bought this phone on the 1st day of launch without knowing what I am going to get from it. But after receiving the phone, I'm quite happy. The phone is fast, light & good in performance. The only drawback for me is that the battery charger doesn't holdup well. For someone who uses the phone only for work & internet, I have to charge twice daily. But it does charge in 15 mins! It's a good buy though!",8 March 2022
150,4.0,Overall nice phone,"Battery life is good, easily lasts a day for my usage, with frequent chat updates, some music playing, once or twice camera usage etc.Display quality, photo quality, sound quality are all above average.However, a bug that disappointed me is that the fingerprint sensor doesn't turn on even in always on display mode. And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now.",22 April 2022
151,4.0,Good choice under 25K segment... you can go for it,"Mobile looks awesome and slim grip is good, camera is average, feel good in hand but back glass is still a problem in summer time as it looks very cheap when you see lots of finger prints on it with very less use.Every thing is fine but the best part is battery charging it just takes only 30-32 minutes to charge 100%Overall experience is good with this mobile.",12 April 2022
152,4.0,Overall a good phone wid decent camera,Phone is very slim and light weight having mirror look at backside.Camera quality is decent not so good for photography and 4k recording is also decent like 1080p recording.There is no heating issue with phone no lag still when I was using wifi with several apps open then it got stuck once when a call came but that's not happening frequently.Overall it's a nice phone with everything upto the mark and having decent camera and awesome speaker sound quality.,7 April 2022
153,1.0,Not upto the mark or the Brand!,"In comparison to many other phones in the same segment, this model does not come upto the mark. Starting on a full charge in the morning the battery drained very fast without any usage and by evening it was 50%. In Oppo, for instance, which was my earlier phone (unfortunately it was stolen), I could watch 2 to 3 films one after another and still the battery would last me the whole day for other heavy usage things. Apart from this the 1+ battery charges very slow. The screen size is smaller, there is half a centimetre gap at the bottom where the screen does not come down right to the edge of the phone. That screen gap irritates as does the time display where the first number is in red. Another irritant as the eyes misread it most of the time! Sound quality is shrill and not nice. Colour display is dull Camera and the pictures taken are ok.",4 May 2022

161,1.0,"Poor mobile exchange process, poor customer care support","I have opted for exchange of redmi note 5 pro for purchase of Nord 2 CE . At the time of exchange, delivery agent was ready to accept the exchange mobile phone. I logged in amazon app , proceeded for exchange verification but at the step of entering verification code, there was a message of updating latest version of app. After that I downloaded latest version of app but problem was not solved . Contacted several times to customer care several times in presence of delivery agent to help. Sometimes call got disconnected? Sometimes received answer to update the app which I already done. There was no  proper technical support but customer care executive insisting on cancel order in stead providing technical support. Finally I had to cancel order due to poor customer care support. Amazon's customer care really does not care about their customers. They don't want to give exchange deals in spite of good working phone. Just harass customers by the declaring lucrative exchange offers. Amazon technical support need improvement.",25 March 2022

165,3.0,Not living up to the name of one plus,"One plus Nord is not up to three name of one plus. The software is little buggy. When a message is typed, the app gets swapped with another one suddenly. User would be stuck to know what had happened.  Fingerprint reader disappers sometimes when a call is in progress. The buttons on homescreen goes away while a call is in progress. There is no lift to wakeup option. Fingerprint reader under the display is really really inconvenient. Chrome tab gets closed with no default blank tab. The annoying privacy alerts when a video call happens, even after notification is turned off.",18 May 2022
166,5.0,Flagship phone under 25K 😍,"Everything is good on this phone 😊😍In hand feel is Awesome, Premium looks !!!Fingerprint sensor(3/5) is Very Good.

In my previous phone, the images were stored in 100-400 kb, but one plus is taking 1.4 - 2 MB for a single image which is toooo much.",6 March 2022

170,5.0,I don't see anything wrong with it. It's just a good phone. Delivery was shite though!,"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too.",6 April 2022

Black colour display come for 1 minute.Camera of POCO is 12 MP and this is 64 MP. STILL poco is best in zooming quality. Only point that camera captures colour in superb way than poco.Finger sensor is slower , unlock is slowerOnly point for me is good in this phone is fast charging which I don't know how many month of years remain same.And 2nd is dedicated slot for memoryThanks but don't go for this phone.",9 March 2022
173,3.0,Worst camera quality,Everything is fine in this phone but the build quality looks much cheaper and camera quality is worst then 10K phones and genuinely my older phone Realme 5 Pro gives much better picture quality then this phone.

3764,5.0,Don't be blind with such Stupid be reviewer,Writing review after 2.5 month usage.I have Bought on same day when it was released in indiaProsVery handy.SlimAnd looks attractiveCamera Quality is good. ( If you want dslr Quality then buy Canon or Sony dslr)Performance is still smooth and bettery life also working on top.Fast charging is ✅💯Not dual stero speakers so not loud speaker sound.Cons.Till now i haven't had any major issues regarding hanging os or anything.Be careful with night light photographyAnddidn't get oxygen 12 update yet.It's matter of  personal choice weather to go for brand or specs.25k is worth for this specs.Trust me mi's some model's 4k video Quality is shit can't compare with OnePlus's 1080p. PS .  i don't play game on phone. If youreally  want to play big then buy PlayStation 😉,30 April 2022
3765,3.0,"Battery, Camera, overall","Battery doesn't go well throughout the day, you need to charge it twice for perfect usageThe camera is also not upto the mark comparing with other OnePlus models.Oppo has taken over this phone likely. Just the branding is OnePlus, the inside of the phone logically speaking is OppoMight wanna go for other options if you want the best. OnePlus lovers are excluded from my previous comment but keep in mind, it's just 5% OnePlus and not more.Goodluck",26 February 2022

3767,4.0,Decent phone to choose instead of Samsung/Redmi,"This is a brief review about one plus Nord ce2.Earlier, I was Samsung’s low-end phone user,So far I have used iPhone 5s/SE, Redmi note 10s, Samsung M01s(last)After some research, I decided to go with this midrange phone with a limit of 20-25k.These are midrange phones (20-28k) now avail in the marketSamsung m52Samsung m53mi11xmi11iMi11 liteOneplus Nord.Motorola (Don’t know the series name)I choose to go with Oneplus Nord ce2 Instead of others. I listed out a few reasons hereExperienceOn paper, Mi Phone specs look top of other phones But trust me, This Nord ce2 gives a better experience than others. I never used Oneplus earlier, So I loved the unboxing, bootup and onboarding experience. I did not get the same experience with other phones like Redmi and Samsung.  I did not find any issues with daily usage. It’s just amazing.Oxygen Os feels great than other UI’s. There are no bloatware apps like Mi.DisplayWhen they say AMOLED, I expected buttery clarity like a google nexus display. But it was ok. Videos/Pictures look crisp and stunning. II looks rich and premium.  Given wallpapers are not great selections but it feels ok.PerformanceAs I said earlier, I was from a low-end phone, I did not find any lag/less response from app usage. All apps work great. Processing times are lower.BatteryI’m not a heavy mobile user, I use it to read news, messages, photography, browse the internet and do finance use like GPay/Phone pe. It came one and half days with my light usage. It charges within 30 mins.PersonalisationOxygen OS is offering lots of customization options, I can choose my theme colours, clock, icon, greeting message, widget options and so on.  As a first time user, I’m starting to love oxygen os.CameraThe camera feels ok. Not great. Normal shots are great. It took good photos in good lighting.  Night shots/Ultra-wide shots look good. I’m still playing with macro photography. Macro shots look plasticky.Final verdictOneplus makes a different phone experience than others. You can consider these phones if- The budget is within 25k. Samsung M52,53 avail at 28k.- Tired of Chinese MI/Oppo/Realmi Phone/OS- To show off (like taking a mirror selfie)- Feel Different from others/crowd.ScoreCamera 3.5/5Display 4.5/5Performance 5/5User Experience 5/5Own Satisfaction 5/5",28 May 2022

3776,1.0,Dont Buy OnePlus....cheap quality...full of defects!,"This is my device in picture...In one year the mother boards of phone is faulty, many people are reporting same problem on the website and YouTube, oneplus is asking for 26k in motherboard replacement. They are not investing time on R&D and are in new phone releasing race.",22 March 2022
3777,5.0,"Decent smartphone, but slightly overpriced.","Perfect device for me.⭐Camera: 64MP omnivision sensor, is average. Details and colours are good. Natural colours when AI is turned off, and slightly boosted when AI is on. HDR management is good, no over exposure issues. Don't expect too much or too low. It's decent average camera. UW lens is okok and Macro is trash btw😅.Front camera is 16mp sony sensor, captures good selfies and here also HDR is very good, unlike mid range Xiaomi phones which completely blow off the sky ( white over exposed sky issue)⭐No bloatwares.⭐ Dedicated SD card slot ( 2 dual sim+ microsd)⭐ Display: Super amoled 90Hz panel. Decent quality display. Much better than IPS LCD. viewing angles are great. No complaints of any sort. We can play 2160p HDR @60fps on YouTube without any issues.⭐ Gaming Performance: Am not a gamer, but I think it shouldn't cause any problem cuz dimensity 900 is a good chipset, and optimized well for this device.⭐Calling: It has google dialer and messeging. No issues works perfectly fine. If you want call recording without announcement go for samsung phones, as besides Samsung there is no other brand left which offers call recording without announcement ( since all brands shifted to google dialer). That's why I won't say this is a con of nord ce 2.⭐No issues in daily normal usage everything works fine. Faced no bugs anywhere.⭐Battery and Charging: Charging is fast. But I feel after software update speed is a bit lower but hey, you shouldn't call it SLOW. it's still pretty fast. For me it went from 50 to 100 in 20-25 minutes. (wifi and data turned off)⭐Battery backup is average. Turning screen to 60Hz doesn't make much difference in bb so I use it at 90hz only, and in moderate usage and brightness around 20-30 percent one can get max 7 hours of screen on time. NOTE: SCREEN ON TIME is very subjective, and depends person to person, brightness level, type of usage , etc.⭐UI AND SOFTWARE: I love it. No bugs, super smooth. Even though it's more like color os it's fine for me. Again it's personal preference.Some things I wished were present in this phone,1. Glass back2. Stereo speakers3. 5000 Mah batteryOther than that it's good.",25 May 2022

3779,1.0,Important!! Consider a read before buying!!,"Absolutely horrible phone brought it when it was released. The software UI was very glitchy and had bugs but after a few updates it was working fine.  But one day my phone got a little wet and that was the end of it (for reference imagine it was raining and a few drops fell on you before you got under a roof and your phone was in your pocker) those few drops of water absolutely wrecked its motherboard and the camera and the touch. When I went to claim the warranty they said it would cost double the phone's mrp in order to fix it enough to work???? Would never have expected this from one plus. Don't buy unless you plan on using it in a desert or in a glass box far away from water, Worst experience ever absolute waste of money.",28 March 2022

3781,5.0,True OnePlus,People have complained abou this being a rebadged Oppo phone but OnePlus have been doing this since OnePlus 1. Oneplus devices are more about experiance then just the specification and I am glad to report that the experience is still True OnePlus . The software is still fast and smooth and have that OnePlus character and the overall experience is far above the Oppo Vivi or Mi. Buy it for the experience of the best the Android has to offer. Fast smooth feature rich no bloatware and no ads atleast as of now even in future OnePlus has promised that they will be bloatware and ads free..,4 March 2022
3782,3.0,Middle range phone,"This is a handy phone with light weight and balanced dimensions. Battery backup is good for one full day normal use with internet. Display quality is good but ambient light sensor response is not sensitive, sometime we have to do it manually for exact brightness. Maximum brightness is not upto the mark. Camera quality is poor. Images are not sharp enough and grains amount is more, trusting OnePlus might correct it for next update. Sound quality is good. Design wise I like it and pocket friendly also.",11 April 2022
3783,2.0,Not too good nor too bad,Its been 10 days using this mobile. Battery drains very fast. Camera quality is ok ok. No extra features or nothing. I expected something from one plus.

But one plus battery disappointed me not only battery in all points.. never expected from one plus.. but only one postive thing is charging is too fast within half n hour completes 100% battery,15 April 2022
